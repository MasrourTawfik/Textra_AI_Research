TEXTRA-IA Research
==================

TEXTRA-IA Research streamlines the process of extracting and synthesizing information from AI research papers. As the volume of scientific publications grows, researchers need better tools to stay informed and understand complex concepts efficiently.

Challenges
-------------
* **Information Overload**: The growing volume of AI publications makes it difficult to track important developments
* **Complex Layouts**: Scientific papers use various formats - multiple columns, tables, figures, and code blocks
* **Concept Navigation**: Researchers need help connecting and understanding related concepts across publications

Our Solution
-----------

Information Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Processes all common article layouts (single-column, multi-column, unstructured)
* Captures tables, figures, equations, and code blocks
* Maintains data integrity across formats

Analysis & Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Generates focused summaries of key findings and methods
* Creates concept graphs showing relationships between topics
* Tracks research evolution over time

How It Works
-----------

1. **Data Collection**: Arxiv scraping and PDF extraction with preprocessing
2. **Layout Analysis**: OCR for text and special elements recognition
3. **Knowledge Base**: Structured storage and graph modeling
4. **Processing**: Concept mapping and trend analysis
5. **Interface**: Clean, intuitive access to visualizations and summaries

TEXTRA-IA Research aims to helps researchers optimize their literature reviews and quickly identify relevant studies.
