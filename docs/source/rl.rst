Proof of Concept: Reinforcement Learning Papers
================================================

The initial implementation focuses on Reinforcement Learning papers. These papers range from pure algorithmic contributions to domain-specific applications in fields like healthcare, robotics, business management and much more.

Understanding Reinforcement Learning Papers
----------------------------------------
RL papers typically fall into several categories, each with distinct structural elements:

- **Core RL Methodology Papers**:
    - Novel algorithm architectures and theoretical foundations
    - Policy and value function innovations
    - Convergence proofs and theoretical guarantees
    - Comparative analyses with existing methods

- **Application-Driven Papers**:
    - Healthcare Applications
    
    - Industrial/Business Applications

    - Robotics Integration

- **Hybrid Approaches**:
    - Combinations with other ML paradigms (supervised, unsupervised)
    - Domain adaptation techniques
    - Transfer learning strategies
    - Multi-task learning frameworks

- **Implementation Details**:
    - Computing infrastructure requirements
    - Data processing pipelines
    - Optimization techniques
    - Deployment strategies

- **Evaluation Frameworks**:
    - Domain-specific metrics
    - Standard RL performance measures
    - Statistical significance tests
    - Ablation studies and comparative analyses

Hierarchical Document Understanding
--------------------------------
We aim to process documents in three layers to ensure thorough comprehension:

1. **Document Level**
    - **Major Section Detection**: Locates primary sections (introduction, methods, experiments, conclusions)
    - **Layout Understanding**: Maps the document structure
    - **Flow Analysis**: Tracks the progression of ideas throughout the paper

2. **Section Level**
    - **Section Relationships**: Maps connections between sections and subsections
    - **Content Classification**: Identifies theoretical content, results, and discussions
    - **Cross-References**: Notes internal and external references for context

3. **Component Level**
    - **Algorithm Blocks**: Captures algorithm details and pseudocode
    - **Mathematical Equations**: Records key mathematical foundations
    - **Figures and Tables**: Extracts data visualizations
    - **Code Snippets**: Preserves implementation examples
